Hey! I am Indhu Cimbali Suresh, studying Master's in Software Engineering. I am currently in third semester. I have an IT experience of two years in Cognizant before my master's. After my first year at Stevens I had interned with CubeSimple as a ServiceNow Developer and later joined Softworld Technology as a Full Stack Java Developer. I am a person who love to work on both Front-End and Back-End. I particularly like to code in Java programing language. I had created a website(https://indhunaidu.inLinks to an external site.) where you can find more information about me. 
Apart from professional life, I have one more world or as people say hobbies. I am a book worm and love to read books(Novels, Story, Fiction etc) and listen to music. I am a huge fan of Cricket Sport. I do pencil sketching of scenarios and portraits. I like to communicate with new people and know more interesting facts and lifestyle.
